<h3 align="center">Direct Cognition of the Absolute</h3>

Aparokṣānubhūti is traditionally regarded as a *Prakaraṇa Grantha*, a concise introductory manual intended to prepare the student for deeper study of Advaita Vedānta. The phrase “Prakaraṇa Grantha” signifies a work that systematically introduces essential doctrines while guiding the aspirant toward direct experiential understanding. In this case, the text focuses on *aparokṣa-anubhūti*—the immediate, non-mediated realization of the Self—which stands apart from indirect or conceptual knowledge. As such, it has long served as a compact gateway into both the philosophical foundations and practical discipline required for self-inquiry.

Although the authorship of *Aparokṣānubhūti* remains a subject of scholarly discussion, this commentary, for simplicity and continuity with tradition, attributes the text to Śrī Śaṅkarācārya. My purpose in writing these notes began as a humble attempt to deepen my Sanskrit studies; yet over time I found the work to be remarkably concise, complete, and suitable for regular contemplative reading by any Advaitic practitioner. I offer my apologies for any inadvertent mistakes, typographical errors, or interpretive shortcomings that may have entered into this effort.

I am indebted especially to Swami Vimuktānanda’s 1938 commentary, which remains, in my view, an indispensable and far more rigorous guide for all beginners. This small work of mine is offered merely as an aid for study and reflection. In an age shaped by technology, it is my hope that learners will find value in this web-based presentation and that it may serve as a helpful companion to the timeless pursuit of Self-knowledge.
